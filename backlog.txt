Epic: ASTRO-EPIC
As an astrophotographer, I would like to know how a filter would affect my astro pictures so that I find the best filter.

Story: ASTRO-0001
As an astronomer, I would like a CLI - Astro Filter Test Tool (AFTT) - to load and store processed file data.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - AFTT should allow to load an image and save it back.
        - An Input parameter (-i) defines the input image location & name.
        - An Output parameter (-o) defines the output image location & name.

Story: ASTRO-0002
As an astrophotographer, I would like to convert from RGB space color to light wavelength color space.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - AFTT should contain a conversion function from hue to light wavelength.
        - AFTT should contain a reverse conversion function from light wavelength to hue.


    Pre-requisites:
        - ASTRO-0001 Story is done.

Story: ASTRO-0003
As an astrophotographer, I would like to specify any filter response via a CSV file based on light wavelength.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - A filter can be loaded based on CSV file.
        - The CSV file defines the filter response as wavelength_in, wavelength_out in nanometer.
        - The filter can be defined for all possible wavelength.

    Pre-requisites:
        - ASTRO-0001 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0002 Story is done.

Story: ASTRO-0004
As an astrophotographer, I would like to apply a filter to an astroimage.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - A filter can be loaded based on CSV file.
        - The CSV file defines the response intensity factor of the original light as intensity_out.
        - The filter is applied to the whole image and saved.

    Pre-requisites:
        - ASTRO-0001 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0002 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0003 Story is done.

Story: ASTRO-0005
As an astrophotographer, I would like to apply chained filters to an astroimage.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - Several filter can be loaded and applied in the proper order.
        - The filters are applied to the whole image and saved.

    Pre-requisites:
        - ASTRO-0001 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0002 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0003 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0004 Story is done.

Story: ASTRO-0006
As an astrophotographer, I would like AFTT to be as fast as possible.

    Acceptance Criterias:
        - The CLI should produce the same results within the shortest timespan.

    Pre-requisites:
        - ASTRO-0001 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0002 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0003 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0004 Story is done.
        - ASTRO-0005 Story is done.
